This library is an unofficial plugin for the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform and contains a simple but fully configurable notification service using [humane.js](http://wavded.github.io/humane-js/). While all options of humane.js are available (instead of adding callbacks, promises are returned where applicable though), basic usage doesn't require more than adding your own css or selecting one of humane.js css files as specified below.

**Note:** If [aurelia i18n](https://github.com/aurelia/i18n) is installed and configured, all notifications get automatically translated. You can turn off translations, either generally in the optional plugin configuration, or for individual notifications.

## Used By

This library is used directly by applications only.

## Platform Support

This library can be used in the **browser** only.

## Installation

Installing this module is fairly simple.

Run `jspm install github:spoonx/aurelia-notification` from your project root.

Either set your own styles or install humane.js with `jspm install github:wavded/humane-js` to have some default styles to choose from.

## Usage

### Configuring the plugin

This module comes with an optional configure method to change the some defaults. You can call it upon registering the plugin.

Make sure your project uses a `main.js` file to initialize aurelia. In your configure function, add the following:

```javascript
aurelia.use
  /* Your other plugins and init code */
  .plugin('spoonx/aurelia-notification', config => {
    config.configure({
      notifications: {
        'success': 'humane-libnotify-success',
        'error': 'humane-libnotify-error',
        'info': 'humane-libnotify-info'
      }
    });
  });
```

### Notification

Import the module, and get cracking.

```javascript
import {inject} from 'aurelia-framework';
import {Notification} from 'spoonx/aurelia-notification';
/* optional:
 * import a css file to use one of the humane.js styles for the notifications.
 * For the four default notification types to display correctly also set the
 * corresponding classes in the plugin configuration (see example above).
 */
// import "wavded/humane-js/themes/libnotify.css!";

@inject(Notification)
export class SomeViewModel {

  constructor (notification) {
    notification.note('Plain');
    notification.success('Record created successfully');
    notification.error('Record creation failed');    
    notification.info('New message');
  }
}
```
